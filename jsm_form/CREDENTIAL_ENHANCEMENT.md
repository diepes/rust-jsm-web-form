# JSM Form Tool - Credential Prompting Enhancement Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. Secure Credential Prompting
- Added `rpassword` dependency for secure password input (passwords are masked)
- Created `ensure_credentials()` function that checks config and prompts if needed

### 2. Smart Credential Detection
The tool now prompts for credentials if:
- Username is empty (`""`) in config
- Password is empty (`""`) in config
- Username is still the placeholder (`"your-username"`)
- Password is still the placeholder (`"your-password"`)

### 3. Input Validation
- Validates that neither username nor password is empty after prompting
- Provides clear error messages for empty credentials
- Shows confirmation of configured username (without exposing password)

### 4. Enhanced Security
- Password input is completely hidden when typing
- Default config now creates empty credential fields
- Updated documentation emphasizes secure credential handling

## Usage Examples

### 1. With empty credentials in config:
```bash
cargo run -- submit -d "summary=Test Issue"
# Output:
# Enter username: [user types username]
# Enter password: [password hidden with asterisks]
# Credentials configured for user: john.doe
# Authenticating...
```

### 2. With stored credentials:
```bash
# Config has username/password filled
cargo run -- submit -d "summary=Test Issue"
# Output:
# Credentials configured for user: john.doe
# Authenticating...
```

## Files Modified

1. **Cargo.toml** - Added `rpassword = "7.3"` dependency
2. **src/main.rs** - Added credential prompting logic
3. **src/config.rs** - Default config now uses empty credentials
4. **README.md** - Updated with security best practices
5. **jsm_config.example.toml** - Updated example to show empty credentials

## Security Benefits

- ✅ No plaintext passwords in config files by default
- ✅ Secure password input (masked/hidden)
- ✅ Validation prevents empty credentials
- ✅ Clear user feedback without exposing sensitive data
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing config files

The tool now provides a much more secure and user-friendly experience for credential management!
